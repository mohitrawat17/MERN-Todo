Hello, This is an intermediate-level fullstack Todo App.

I've built this project as a part of learning. The main objective was to build the frontend using React and tailwindcss and backend using NoSQL and express. I have used Tailwindcss for styling components.

Tech Stack :

JavaScript (ES6+)
ReactJS
Tailwindcss
Express.js
MongoDB

Usage : Clone the repo and run npm install for both client and server to get all dependencies installed on your local machine then you can start using it by running npm start in client as well as in server.
